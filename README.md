Data Preparation & Cleaning
Performed in Power Query:
Removed unused tables & columns to reduce model size.
Renamed columns for readability (e.g., SalesOrderHeader.SalesOrderID ‚Üí Order ID).

Merged related tables:
SalesOrderHeader + SalesOrderDetail ‚Üí unified sales table.
Joined Product, ProductSubcategory, ProductCategory to get full hierarchy.
Replaced nulls with zeros / ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù.
Created calculated columns

Data Modeling
Designed a clean star schema
Relationships:

Sales[CustomerID] ‚Üí Customer[CustomerID]

Sales[ProductID] ‚Üí Product[ProductID]

Sales[TerritoryID] ‚Üí SalesTerritory[TerritoryID]

Sales[OrderDate] ‚Üí Date[Date]

Marked the Date table as the official date dimension for time intelligence.
